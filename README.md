# handwritten-digit-recognition
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, and serves as a foundational project for understanding image classification.

# Objectives
Build a digit classifier using deep learning techniques

Train the model on the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 labeled images

Evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data

Visualize predictions and analyze classification accuracy

#Approach
Preprocess and normalize image data

Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification

Train the model using TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and sample predictions

 #Tools & Technologies
Python

TensorFlow, Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook
